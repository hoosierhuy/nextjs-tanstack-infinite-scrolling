The purpose of this repository is to teach you how to develop a Next.js application with infinite scrolling, using Tanstack Query's `useInfiniteQuery` hook, and the [react-intersection-observer library](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer), which is React's implementation of the Intersection Observer API, to detect when an element enters or leaves a viewport. This doc is a great demonstration for react-intersection-observer: https://react-intersection-observer.vercel.app/?path=/docs/intro--docs. We will be using [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/) for linting.

There are two branches in this repository: `main` will be the completed project, and `starter` will be the starting point for the tutorial. There will also be an accompanying YouTube video.
